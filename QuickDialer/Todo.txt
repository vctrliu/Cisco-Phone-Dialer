Notes:

1) Save to the app.exe.config file doesn't work 
DONE2) Implement a nested structure for the phone book?
DONE3) Add a SQL database? How much space will this take up?
2)Figure out enter key for treeview
3)Enhance keyboard navigation
 a)Figure out auto select a node when opening phonebook tab to allow keyboard navigation
 b)Insert tooltips for Buttons? (Call= Alt+C, Enter, etc)

 4)Add buttons to collection to simplify management??



Things to merge:
1. PCTS Combo box
2. PCTS Cbo update
3. Load PCTS contacts
4. Combo selected change actions
5. Clean up call flow (eg when items get added to txtinput.text)


To do:
1. xFix Phonebook customer name not updating bug
2. xFix tab index for spddial index.
		Not sure how to do this correctly, it goes from panel 1 to panel 2. Can it jump panels?
3. xSend to system tray
